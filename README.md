# Jobox-Project : Job Recommendation Systems based on User Resume or CV

Jobox is a website that makes it easy for job seekers to find the best jobs based on their resume or CV. We provide job recommendations by matching applicants' skills and job descriptions using artificial intelligence. It will reduce the time in looking for a job instead of searching and checking every job posting and whether are eligible to apply for this job or not. Users only need to enter their resume or CV then our program will provide jobs that match the user's skills
